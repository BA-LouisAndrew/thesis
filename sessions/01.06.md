## Progress (Project Wide)
**https://github.com/BA-LouisAndrew/thesis/compare/v0.0.1-prod.0...main**
- User stories out of the use-case diagram -> https://github.com/BA-LouisAndrew/thesis/blob/main/diagrams/use-case.png
- Add some detailed criteria for the SQR (Software Quality Requirements) -> https://github.com/BA-LouisAndrew/thesis/tree/main/chapters/analysis#sqr-based-on-isoeic-250102011
- RMQ POC is done, localhost connection, run using `brew` or `docker` -> https://github.com/BA-LouisAndrew/poc/tree/ft/I/16--setup-rmq/src
- Database + Prisma as ORM. TS compliance
- Use `retryStrategy` with `got` -> Using what's there and not building something else from the ground up
- Create system, architecture + tech stack diagram -> https://github.com/BA-LouisAndrew/thesis/tree/main/diagrams
- Github milestones -> https://github.com/orgs/BA-LouisAndrew/projects/1/views/1

## UI - https://github.com/BA-LouisAndrew/ui
- Mock ups: https://www.figma.com/file/5Egt43HhE16AZfy0TqZwWa/Bachelorarbeit---Mockups?node-id=504%3A3726
- UI live link: https://louisandrew-bachelorarbeit.netlify.app/
  - https://louisandrew-bachelorarbeit.netlify.app/#/rules -> List rules
  - https://louisandrew-bachelorarbeit.netlify.app/#/rules/Test -> Rules CRUD page
  - https://louisandrew-bachelorarbeit.netlify.app/#/validations -> List validations (WIP)
  - https://louisandrew-bachelorarbeit.netlify.app/#/validations/validation-1 -> Validation progress
- Techs: Vue3, Naive UI (supposed to be ChakraUI, but not compatible), TS, Vite, deployed on Netlify
- CI/CD steps, test and build on PR. Environment variables loading for URL and stuff
- Routing with VueRouter
- Error handling, actively trying to prevent error caused by user (e.g. falsy model, invalid attrs)
- UI is not very straight forward, more info about what certain attributes mean, info about `fraudScore`, info about what `conditions` means
- Customer form (mock registration / sign up, then run validation on this customer) is next
- Used the same type definition as the backend for `Validation`, `ValidationRule`, `ValidationResult` and so on
- TDD, vitest, testing the behavior of the UI rather than the methods

## FDS (Fraud Detection Service / Backend) - https://github.com/BA-LouisAndrew/fds
- Deployed on Heroku, CI/CD steps. Test and build on PR. Deploy on merge to `main` as docker container
- Swagger -> https://louisandrew-bachelorarbeit.herokuapp.com/docs/
  - `/rules` -> Rules CRUD. Stored on Mongo. ORM is Prisma
  - `/validate` -> "Validation engine" endpoint. `POST` to run validation (async) against customer. `/validate/{validationId}` to get current progress. `/validate/{validationId}/subscribe` to subscribe on validation progress with the given ID.
  - `/utils` -> Utility functions. External checks
- Techs: NodeJS, TypeScript, Express + TSOA (OOP-like, MVC, Auto-Swagger), Vitest, Docker!?, Prisma ORM
- Tried to make use of MVC pattern (controller -> routing. service -> business logic and so on)
- Tried to make use of as many design patterns as possible
  - Event Bus?
  - Singleton -> database, datastore, event bus, 
  - Repository with `DataStore` object as source of truth
  - Dependency injection?
  - Abstract factory -> `DataStore` type (`RedisStore | InMemoryStore`), `Operator` (`validationEngine`)
- TDD, Testing made possible with dependency injection to lots of singleton (use mock context for database in testing)
- Validation engine -> Runs the validation (for a single rule or for multiple rules)
  - Async or sync. Async -> non blocking. get data via polling / subscription 
  - Heavily inspired by: https://github.com/CacheControl/json-rules-engine 
- Show TS model
- Wanted to use redis on live env (heroku), stumbled upon limiting factor (max 25 keys). Stringify values might do the trick. Going to fix
