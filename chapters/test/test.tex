\chapter{Test}

  Testing is an integral part of software development. Writing tests gives the developer the confidence that the recent changes made will not break the remaining parts of the software. The system is built by writing the tests before implementing the particular features (also known as \emph{TDD} method), in hope that the tests can help reduce the amount of bugs in the system while also providing a code-level working specification of the particular component. The technology used to run test suites for both the FDS and the UI is \emph{vitest}\footnote{\emph{Vitest} is a unit test framework, with out-of-box TypeScript support and Vite native compatibility. GitHub repository: \url{https://github.com/vitest-dev/vitest}.}. This chapter discusses the tests written during the development process.
