\section{Controller}

  This chapter describes the implementation of the features elicited on the previous chapters in details, specifically within the FDS component. All the HTTP routes of the FDS will be prefixed with \verb;/api/v1;.

  \subsection{Customer Validation on a Registration Event}

    An HTTP endpoint will be implemented to provide the possibility to schedule a validation process as soon as a new customer is registered. The endpoint should accept the customer information on the request body and return validation ID and additional information of the validation process as a response. Listed below is the code snippet of the HTTP controller of the endpoint to schedule a validation process:

    \begin{lstlisting}[style=es6, caption={HTTP controller of an endpoint to schedule a validation process (TypeScript)}]
// fds/src/routes/validation/validationController.ts

// Picks the `validationId` and `additionalInfo` attributes from `Validation` 
type ValidationSchedule = Pick<Validation, "validationId" | "additionalInfo"> 
     
@Route("validate")
@Tags("Validation")
export class ValidationController extends Controller {
  @SuccessResponse(201, "Validation started")
  @Response<ValidationErrorJSON>(422, "Validation Failed")
  @Response<WentWrong>(400, "Bad Request")
  @Post()
  public async validateCustomer(
   @Body() requestBody: Customer
  ): Promise<ValidationSchedule | WentWrong> {
    const result = await ValidationService.scheduleRulesetValidation(requestBody)
    const { data, error } = result

    if (error) {
      this.setStatus(400)
      return {
        message: error.message,
        details: error.details || "",
      }
    }

    return data
  }
} 
    \end{lstlisting}
    
    The HTTP controller is intentionally kept as simple as possible. The logic behind the process to schedule a validation is done by the \verb;ValidationService; and \verb;ValidationEngine; (discussed in \autoref{sub:process}). The \verb;ValidationService; is responsible in this particular case to get the lists of existing validation rules and runtime secrets (discussed in \autoref{sub:secrets}), then creating a new instance of \verb;ValidationEngine; as well as scheduling a new validation process. 

    \begin{lstlisting}[style=es6, caption={ValidationService schedule validation implementation (TypeScript)}]
// fds/src/routes/validation/validationService.ts

export class ValidationService {
  static async scheduleRulesetValidation(
    customer: Customer
  ): Promise<ApiResponse<ValidationSchedule>> {
    const { data: ruleset, error } = await RulesService.listRules()
    const secrets = await SecretsService.listSecrets()
    if (error) {
      return {
        data: null,
        error,
      }
    }

    const { validationId, additionalInfo } = await new ValidationEngine<Customer>()
      .setRuleset(ruleset)
      .setSecrets(secrets)
      .scheduleRulesetValidation(customer)

    return {
      data: {
        validationId,
        additionalInfo,
      },
      error: null,
    }
  }
}
    \end{lstlisting}

  \subsection{Validation Process}
    \label{sub:process}

    \subsubsection{Validation Process Flow}
    
      A validation process is started by iterating through a list of validation rules, making an HTTP request to the external endpoint listed on each rule and evaluating its response in comparison to the conditions attached on the rule. If the HTTP response from the external matches the conditions of the rule, the rule evaluation will be considered as a passed evaluation, otherwise it is a failed evaluation. The result of each rule evaluation determines the value of the resulting fraud score. The resulting fraud score will be calculated as follows: 

      \begin{itemize}
        \item Initialize an empty list of fraud scores. The list will be filled later with float numbers ranging between 0 and 1
        \item Go through the list of validation rules and run evaluation
        \item If the evaluation passed, append \verb;0; to the list of fraud scores
        \item Otherwise, append the validation rule \verb;failScore; attribute's value to the list of fraud scores
        \item At the end of the iteration, the list size should equal to the amount of available\footnote{\emph{Not skipped.}} validation rules
        \item The resulting fraud score is the sum of the scores in the list, divided by the number of available validation rules
      \end{itemize}
      
      In summary, the flow of a validation process will be represented by the flow diagram below:

      \begin{figure}[!ht]
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{diagrams/flow_validation_process.jpeg}
        \caption{Flow diagram of a validation process}
        \label{fig:flow_validation}
      \end{figure}
      
      The flow listed above will be executed by creating a \verb;ValidationEngine; instance and calling a public \verb;secheduleRulesetValidation; method. Before running a validation process, the list of validation rules as well as runtime secrets should be provided to the engine. The \verb;ValidationEngine; class uses method chaining\footnote{\emph{Method chaining} is a method to provide the possibility of invoking multiple method calls of an object without having to store an intermediary result in an additional variable.} as well as the \emph{Builder} design pattern discussed in \autocite[pp. 97-106]{gamma-1995} for its construction, to make the public API of a validation engine as simple as possible.

      \begin{lstlisting}[style=es6, caption={ValidationEngine class and the scheduleRulesetValidation method (TypeScript)}]
// fds/src/engine/valdiationEngine.ts
export class ValidationEngine<T> {
  private secrets: GenericObject = {}
  private ruleset: ValidationRule[] = []

  setSecrets(secrets: GenericObject) {
    this.secrets = secrets
    return this
  }

  setRuleset(ruleset: ValidationRule[]) {
    this.ruleset = [...ruleset.sort((a, b) => b.priority - a.priority)]
    return this
  }

  async scheduleRulesetValidation(data: T): Promise<Validation<T>> {
    if (this.ruleset.length === 0) {
      throw new Error("Ruleset is not set")
    }

    await this.constructValidationObject(data) // Construct a validation result
    this.validateRuleset(data)

    return this.validationResult
  }

  async validateRuleset(data: T): Promise<Validation<T>> {
    if (this.ruleset.length === 0) {
      throw new Error("Ruleset is not set")
    }

    if (!this.validation) {
      await this.constructValidationObject(data)
    }

    for await (const rule of this.ruleset.filter(({ skip }) => !skip)) {
      const evaluationResult = await this.evaluateRule(rule, data)
      await this.reviewEvaluationResult(evaluationResult, rule)
    }

    await this.afterValidation()

    return this.validationResult
  }
}
      \end{lstlisting}

    \subsubsection{Accessing Data by Evaluating JSONPath Expressions}
      
      To be able to access essential information stored in the current runtime scope a validation process, a JSONPath expression can be used in certain attributes of a validation rule. The provided runtime information of a validation process includes the customer information, runtime secrets and during a condition evaluation, the HTTP response from the external endpoint of the particular rule. 

      The ability to access certain information from the runtime scope is needed when an HTTP request is made and during the evaluation of a condition. To evaluate a JSONPath expression, the \verb;jsonpath; library is used. 

      \begin{lstlisting}[style=es6, caption={Accessing runtime information using JSONPath expression (TypeScript)}]
import jp from "jsonpath"

const accessDataFromPath = (runtimeData: any, expression: any) => {
  if (typeof expression !== "string") {
    return expression // A valid JSONPath expression is a string
  }
  
  try {
    const [dataFromPath] = jp.query(runtimeData, expression)
    if (!dataFromPath) {
      // Expression is valid, but the path doesn't point to a specific value
      return expression 
    }

    return dataFromPath
  } catch {
    return expression // The expression is either not a valid JSONPath expression
  }
}
      \end{lstlisting}

    \subsubsection{Making an HTTP Request to External Endpoints}

      A dedicated class (\verb;Agent;) is created to make an HTTP request to the external endpoint. The class will provide a layer of abstraction on top of the Got library that is being used to actually make the HTTP requests. 
      
      The class will also help in setting the request body, request header as well as to change the variables on the \verb;endpoint; attribute with its corresponding values. The class follows the \emph{Singleton} design pattern described in \autocite[pp. 127-134]{gamma-1995}, as there might only one instance needed for the whole application. The class is also implemented using the dependency injection in mind, for an easier access to the underlying library during the testing phase. The dependency injection is implemented by providing a \verb;context; object to the \verb;Agent; class beforehand. During runtime, the \verb;context; object contains a Got instance, used to make HTTP requests. In testing environment, the \verb;context; object contains a mocked Got instance.

      \begin{lstlisting}[style=es6, caption={Usage of the singleton pattern and dependency injection in Agent class (TypeScript)}]
export class Agent {
  private static context: Context // Dependency injection

  private static get client() {
    return Agent.context.client // `client` object is a Got instance
  }

  static setClient(context: Context) {
    this.context = context
  }
}
      \end{lstlisting}

    \subsubsection{Operators}

      \verb;Operators; are special classes that define the operation of a certain condition during a validation process. Each \verb;Operator; is grouped by its type and has two main properties \verb;identifier;, and \verb;operateFunction;
      
      The \verb;identifier; property of an operator refers to the operator's name, unique on its group of type. The \verb;identifier; attribute of an operator will be passed into the \verb;operator; attribute of a condition to describe the specific operator to be used in evaluating the particular condition. The \verb;operateFunction; attribute of an operator is a function that accepts two arguments, and returns a boolean value that indicates whether the operation is successful. An additional validation process is also implemented using the \verb;validateFunction; property to make sure that the value being passed into the \verb;operate; function of an operator is valid. The \verb;identifier; and \verb;operateFunction; attributes of an operator are passed into the object constructor during its initialization, while the \verb;validateFunction; attribute of an operator is defined by each subclass of the operator, grouped by its type.  
      
      \begin{lstlisting}[style=es6, caption={NumberOperator example (TypeScript)}]
export class NumberOperator extends Operator<number, NumberOperatorIds> {
  const validateFunction = (value) =>
    typeof value === "number" &&
    !isNaN(parseFloat(`${value}`))
}

export const numberOperators: Record<NumberOperatorIds, NumberOperator> = {
  eq: new NumberOperator("eq", (a, b) => b === a),
  gt: new NumberOperator("gt", (a, b) => b > a),
  gte: new NumberOperator("gte", (a, b) => b >= a),
  lt: new NumberOperator("lt", (a, b) => b < a),
  lte: new NumberOperator("lte", (a, b) => b <= a),
} 
      \end{lstlisting}

      The \emph{Flyweight} design pattern mentioned in \autocite[pp. 195-206]{gamma-1995} is used here, by instantiating all the available operators beforehand, and using the instantiated object during a condition evaluation. For an even easier access to the operators, a \emph{flyweight factory} is also created. The \verb;OperatorFactory; will return the appropriate operator to be used based on the type and identifier passed. If the combination of type and identifier of an operator doesn't point into a specific operator, a \verb;NullishOperator; will be returned, which always return \verb;false; as its operation result. 

    \subsubsection{Evaluating a Rule} 
      
      To evaluate a certain validation rule, the \verb;Evaluator; class is created. The \verb;Evaluator; class is responsible in running an evaluation regarding a certain condition. An evaluator works together with the \verb;Operator; class in evaluating the conditions given. The specific operator to evaluate a condition is accessed via the \verb;OperatorFactory;. The \verb;Evaluator; class encapsulates the internal logic of evaluating a condition and running the operations defined by the particular condition. The \verb;Evaluator; class is also responsible in accessing the required data described by a JSONPath expression from the runtime information of a validation process. 

      \begin{lstlisting}[style=es6, caption={The usage of OperatorFactory class in the Evaluator class (TypeScript)}]
// Evaluate JSONPath expressions.
const dataFromPath = this.accessDataFromPath(runtimeData, validationRule.path)
const valueFromPath = this.accessDataFromPath(runtimeData, validationRule.value)
        
const operator = OperatorFactory.getOperator(
  validationRule.type,
  validationRule.operator,
)
const isEvaluationPassed = operator.operate(valueFromPath, dataFromPath)
      \end{lstlisting}
      
      As mentioned before, a condition can either be a single condition, or multiple conditions, wrapped inside an \verb;any; or \verb;all; attribute. The evaluation of a single condition is different from the evaluation of multiple conditions. To facilitate the different logic of evaluating conditions, two subclasses of the \verb;Evaluator; class is created. \verb;ConditionEvaluator; is responsible in evaluating a single condition, while the \verb;BooleanConditionEvaluator; is in charge in evaluating multiple conditions and handling the logic behind evaluating the \verb;any; and \verb;all; modifier. To simplify the instantiation of the suitable \verb;Evaluator; subclass, the \verb;EvaluatorFactory; class is created, following the \emph{Factory Method} design pattern described in \autocite[pp. 107-116]{gamma-1995}. 

      \begin{lstlisting}[style=es6, caption={EvaluatorFactory usage in ValidationEngine class (TypeScript)}]
const response = await Agent.fireRequest(rule, {
  customer: customerData,
  secrets: this.secrets
})

const evaluator = EvaluatorFactory.getEvaluator(condition)
const evaluationResult = evaluator.evaluate({
  response: response.responseData,
  customer: customerData,
  secrets: this.secrets
})
      \end{lstlisting}

      As the evaluation result, an \verb;Evaluator; instance will return an object with the \verb;pass; attribute to determine whether the evaluation passed and an additional \verb;messages; attribute, which contains essential information regarding the evaluation (including the value of \verb;failMessage; attribute of a condition, if the evaluation fails).
