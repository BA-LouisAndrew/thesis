\section{Model}

In this chapter, the specific implementation of the models described in \autoref{subsection:model} will be discussed. 

 \subsection{Validation Rule}
  To implement the model defined in \autoref{fig:uml_validation_rule}, a TypeScript interface is created to help in providing a clear structure during development phase. A \emph{Prisma} schema\footnote{The \emph{Prisma} database schema is listed on \autoref{code:prisma}} is also created to define the MongoDB database schema as well as to keep the structure of the data saved in the database in sync with the latest TypeScript interface. 

  \begin{lstlisting}[caption={TypeScript interface of a validation rule (TypeScript)}, language=js]
 // fds/src/types/rule.d.ts
 
 export interface ValidationRule {
   retryStrategy?: RetryStrategy | null
   requestUrlParameter?: GenericObject
   requestHeader?: GenericObject
   skip: boolean
   requestBody?: GenericObject
   condition: Condition | BooleanCondition
   method: "GET" | "PUT" | "POST" 
   failScore: number
   endpoint: string
   priority: number
   name: string
 }
 
 type GenericObject = { [key: string]: any } // Dictionary
 type Condition = {
   path: string
   operator: OperatorType
   type: ConditionType
   value: any
   failMessage: string
 }

 type BooleanCondition = {
   all: Condition[]
 } | {
   any: Condition[]
 }

 type RetryStrategy = {
   limit: number
   statusCodes: number[] 
 }
  \end{lstlisting}
 
 \subsubsection{Retry Strategy}
  The \verb;retryStrategy; attribute of the validation rule model is very specific to the implementation of the FDS. The FDS is using a library called \emph{Got}\footnote{\emph{Got} is a Node.JS library to make HTTP requests. GitHub repository: \url{https://github.com/sindresorhus/got}.} to make HTTP requests to the external endpoints. Got provides the functionality to retry a failed HTTP request out of the box\footnote{For more information on Got's retry options, please refer to \url{https://github.com/sindresorhus/got/blob/main/documentation/7-retry.md}.}.

  The \verb;retryStrategy; attribute of a validation rule is a subset of the retry options provided by Got's retry API, and will be passed to the Got instance when the HTTP request is made for the corresponding rule evaluation.
