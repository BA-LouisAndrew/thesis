\section{Software Design}

Software design is an important step that should be done before the implementation of the software. It provides a plan on how the software can fulfill the requirements and decisions made during this process are vital in determining how the software should be implemented. The system is divided into three layers: \emph{presentation layer}, \emph{business layer} and the \emph{database layer}, inspired by the \emph{Layered Architecture} pattern described in \autocite{richards2015software}\footnote{The message broker component is not part of the layered architecture.}. This chapter describes the design process of the system and its layers.
