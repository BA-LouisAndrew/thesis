The system was implemented using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) programming approach. The system does not strictly adhere to the MVC pattern, but uses it as a guideline to categorize the components of the system and its functionalities. Krasner and Pope \autocite{krasner-pope-88} discussed the benefit of using the MVC pattern to provide modularity by isolating functional components of the system, making it easier to design and modify.
