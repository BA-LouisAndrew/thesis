\section{Requirements}

  This chapter lists the requirements of the system by extracting the use cases from the goal of the research project and its priorities. 

  \subsection{Use Cases}
    \label{use_cases}

    A use case diagram is created to better visualize the flow and possible use cases of the system on a high level based on the goal of the research project.

    \begin{figure}[!ht]
     \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{diagrams/use-case-diagram.png}
     \caption{Use case diagram of the fraud detection system}
     \label{fig:use_cases}
    \end{figure}

    The use case diagram gives a visual representation of the main functionality of the system as well as the actor involved in the process. The customer data validation will be run whenever a customer registers or updates his/her personal data. By running a validation whenever an operation on personal data is executed, the system would ideally validate and identify fraudulent customer as soon as possible. 
    
    Whenever a fraudulent customer is identified, a notification will be sent to concerned parties, so that necessary actions (for example, blocking the customer) can be taken as soon as possible. 

    The diagram also visualizes a use case of a validation rule creation by a team member, as a form of contribution based on his/her knowledge of a fraudulent customer with the intention to improve the reliability of the validation process.

  \subsection{User Stories}
    \label{user_stories}

    Based on the use cases visualized on \autoref{fig:use_cases}, the following user stories can be defined:

    \begin{itemize}[label={},leftmargin=*]
      \item \textbf{Verifying Customer Early}
        \begin{itemize}[label={},leftmargin=*]
          \item As a stakeholder, I want to verify customers, so that the company can have more confidence that the existing user base is trustworthy 
        \end{itemize}

      \item \textbf{Notification on Suspicious Cases}
        \begin{itemize}[label={},leftmargin=*]
          \item As an employee, I want to be notified when a user seems suspicious, so that I can do necessary actions accordingly
        \end{itemize}

      \item \textbf{Validation Rules Management}
        \begin{itemize}[label={},leftmargin=*]
          \item As an employee, I want to manage my own rule to validate users, so that I can use my expertise to find suspicious customers as efficiently as possible without the communication overhead with other teams
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}

    The user stories listed above are the main requirements of the system. The functionalities of the system will be defined and implemented based on these user stories.
    
  \subsection{Software Quality Standard}
    \label{criteria}

    The system and software quality models defined in ISO 25010 \autocite{iso-2011} are used to establish a base on how to evaluate the quality of the system made for this research project. The table below contains a list of criteria taken from the software quality characteristics and its sub-characteristics described in ISO 20510, the meaning of each sub-characteristic and its importance to the research project. The criteria will be revisited during evaluation to assess the quality of the software made during the research project.
