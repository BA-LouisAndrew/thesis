\section{State of the Art}

  Fraud detection and prevention intrinsically is a big topic. There are many scientific papers published regarding fraud detection / prevention, suggesting approaches with different methods and algorithms to create a system that could predict a fraud case as accurately as possible. 

  There are also quite a lot of service providers that offer a tailor-built fraud detection system, usually works using machine learning to analyze the data provided to the system. 
  
  However, this research project intends neither to come up with a new technique to better predict a fraud case nor to compete with the existing service providers, but rather to explore a possibility of how the domain knowledge from multiple independent teams can be combined to produce a reliable fraud detection system, enabling collaboration across different domains.
