\section{Goal}

 The system should be able to provide a possibility for different teams to contribute on the fraud detection process independently, based on their views and knowledge on the characteristics of a potentially fraudulent customer. In such a way, the system can help in transforming the fraud detection process to be a collaborative process and each team make a contribution by making it more reliable as their knowledge increases. Primarily, the system should enable collaboration across autonomous teams in a fraud detection process and simplify it by encapsulating the internal logic while presenting the result in an understandable format.
