\section{Goal}

  The goal of the research project is to build a fraud detection system that provides a possibility for different teams to contribute on the fraud detection process independently, based on their views and knowledge on the characteristics of a potentially fraudulent customer. In such a way, the system can help in transforming the fraud detection process to be a collaborative process and each team can make a contribution by making it more reliable as their knowledge increases. The system should enable collaboration across autonomous teams in a fraud detection process and simplify it by encapsulating the internal logic while presenting the result in an understandable format. The system is responsible primarily in determining whether a customer is likely fraudulent based on the information contributed by the different teams and notifying the concerned parties on certain cases when needed.
