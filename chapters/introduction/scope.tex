\section{Scope}

  The main purpose of this research project is to explore any possibility to facilitate a collaboration for several autonomous teams in a single fraud detection process while also providing crucial functionalities such as a notification system. 

  This project won't necessarily undertake aspects such as GDPR compliance and authentication of the system. Therefore, the system is not ready for production and further improvements on these aspects is required. The result of this research project is an explorative work, and may be used as a base for future projects in similar domain.
