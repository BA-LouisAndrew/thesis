% \section{Scope}

  % The main purpose of this research project is to facilitate a collaboration for multiple autonomous teams in a single fraud detection process, while also providing crucial functionalities such as a notification system. 

  % This project won't necessarily undertake aspects such as GDPR compliance and authentication process. Therefore, the system is not ready for production and further improvements on these aspects are required. The result of this research project is an explorative work, and may be used as a base for future projects in similar domain.
