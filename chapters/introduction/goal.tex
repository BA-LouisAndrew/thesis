\section{Goal and Scope}

  The goal of this research project is to explore the possibility to build a system to detect and/or prevent fraud activities while providing the opportunity for multiple autonomous teams to contribute to the process by leveraging their domain knowledge and expertise.

  This project won't necessarily undertake aspects such as GDPR compliance and authentication process. Therefore, the system is not ready for production and further improvements on these aspects are required. The result of this research project is an explorative work, and may be used as a base for future projects in similar domain.
