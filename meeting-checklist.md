- [x] Sequence diagrams
- [x] Analysis draft + points 
- [x] Implementation notes (back end technologies)
  - [x] Async comms issue. UI Progress
  - [x] Web socket vs SSE
  - [x] Node vs other CPU-intensive langs
- [x] Kafka vs RMQ
  - Kafka is too big
  - Redis if only have performance issue. Can be used to have a complex system. 15 mins to set it up. No big benefit -> as a caching database!
  - Store anything to Redis?
- Add SAML/similar ideas/specific JS libs on front end(s) to establish a "handshake" and be sure that the connection is safe
- Put all diagrams into the thesis -> Show how deep you went
- Don't directly write that u use *technical* user story , but explain why
- ```As a stakeholder (team A member), I would like to persist the information about a security check that I built in a database, so that the FDS can access it every time a validation is executed, and I can update how the response from the security check should look like without having to update the FDS``` 
  - Still very technical
  - Separate technical, and non-technical user story!
  - 100% Sure -> about kind of user story
  - Put into system architecture part
- As a stakeholder, I want to verify users, so that the company can have more confidence and the existing user base is most probably trustworthy â˜…
- Analysis -> High level user story -> Implementation: break it down.
- Use case diagram for analysis
- Implementations -> Use patterns

### TODO
All todos are converted into gh issue.
- [x] Write non-technical use cases
- [x] Use case diagram for analysis
- [x] SQR descriptions
